    <string name="text_me_desc">In 1928, George plans a world tour before college
        and is reintroduced to Mary Hatch, who has always had a crush on him.
        The attraction is now mutual. When his father suffers a stroke and dies,
        George postpones his travel to sort out the family business,
        Bailey Brothers Building and Loan, which avaricious board
        member Henry F. Potter, who controls most of the town\'s businesses,
        seeks to dissolve. The other board members vote to keep the Building
        and Loan open if George will run it. George acquiesces and
        works alongside his uncle, Billy, and gives his tuition to Harry,
        with the understanding that Harry will run the business when he graduates.
        \n\n

        Harry returns from college married and with an excellent
        job offer from his father-in-law. George is dejected but doesn\'t
        stand in Harry\'s way and continues running Building and Loan.
        Immediately following their wedding, George and Mary witness a run on the bank,
        and use their $2,000 honeymoon savings to keep the Building and Loan solvent.
        \n\n
        Under George\'s leadership, the company eventually establishes Bailey Park,
        a modern housing development to rival Potter\'s overpriced slums.
        Potter offers George $20,000 a year to be his assistant, but,
        realizing that Potter\'s true intention is to shut down the Building and Loan,
            George rebuffs and rebukes him.
